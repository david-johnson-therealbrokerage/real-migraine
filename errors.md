# Error Log

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Firestore Query Errors
- **Issue**: Firestore queries failing due to missing indexes
- **Fix**: Added fallback queries without ordering and in-memory sorting

### 2. User Document Initialization
- **Issue**: Permission denied when creating user documents
- **Fix**: Added graceful error handling and continue app operation

### 3. Dashboard Stats Calculation
- **Issue**: Errors when Firebase not properly configured
- **Fix**: Added authentication checks and empty data fallbacks

## Current Status
All errors have been addressed with graceful fallbacks. The app will:
- Work with local storage when Firebase is not configured
- Show empty data instead of errors when Firestore is unavailable
- Automatically create indexes when queries are first run
- Continue working even if some Firebase services fail

## To Deploy Firestore Indexes
If you're seeing index-related warnings in the console, run:
```bash
npm run deploy:firestore
```
